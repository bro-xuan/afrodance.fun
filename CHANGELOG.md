All notable changes to afrodance.fun are documented here.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **BTC Bottom Indicator** (`/bottom_indicator`): a new on-chain dashboard that scores
  Bitcoin against a basket of valuation signals (MVRV, MVRV Z-Score, NUPL, SOPR, Reserve
  Risk, STH/LTH MVRV, Realized Price, Balanced Price). Each signal is scored 0–100 by its
  percentile across full history, with a Phase badge, 30-day change, and an orange→blue
  gradient meter. Includes an aggregate signal headline and live BTC spot price.
- `npm run fetch:indicators` script that pulls on-chain metrics from the keyless
  bitcoin-data.com API and BTC price history from Binance, computes the scores locally,
  and writes a committed snapshot (`src/app/bottom_indicator/data/indicators.json`) so the
  page renders statically with no runtime API calls.
- Homepage Projects grid now links to the BTC Bottom Indicator.
